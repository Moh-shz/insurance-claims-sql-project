# Insurance Claims SQL + Tableau Dashboard

This project demonstrates end-to-end **data preparation, SQL analytics, and visualisation** of an insurance claims dataset with **58K+ policies**.  
The goal is to explore **claim rates** by region, customer demographics, vehicle models, and safety features, and to present the insights in an interactive **Tableau dashboard**.

## ðŸš€ Steps in the Project

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded raw insurance dataset (`Insurance claims data.csv`) into a **staging table** (`stage_claims_raw`).
- Designed a relational schema with separate tables:
  - `policyholders`
  - `vehicles`

### 2. SQL Analytics
- Analytical queries to calculate:
  - Claim rates by **region**
  - Claim rates by **customer age group**
  - Relationship between **safety features** (ESC, parking sensors) and claims
  - Top vehicle models by claim count
  - Claim rates by **Age Ã— Region Ã— Fuel Type**

### 3. Visualisation & Reporting
- Exported SQL query outputs to CSV.
- Built an interactive **Tableau dashboard** with multiple pages:
  - **Overview**: Total policies, claims, claim rate
  - **By Region**: Claims & claim rates per region
  - **By Demographics**: Claims by age group & segment
  - **By Vehicle & Safety**: Vehicle models and safety features vs claim rates

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Preview

The following dashboard was built in **Tableau** using query outputs:

You can interact with the live dashboard here:

This dashboard is also published on Tableau Public:

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
- **Claims by Age Group**: Younger and older age groups show different claim rates.  
- **Claims by Region**: Certain regions have disproportionately higher claim frequencies.  
- **Claims by Vehicle Model**: Some vehicle models are more prone to claims.  
- **Impact of Safety Features (ESC, Parking Sensors)**: Policies linked to vehicles with safety features show lower claim rates.  
- **Fuel Type & Age Group**: Claim rates vary across CNG, Diesel, and Petrol users, especially within younger age groups.

## ðŸ“Œ How to Reproduce
1. Run the SQL scripts in `sql/` (via PostgreSQL + pgAdmin).  
2. Import the dataset into the staging table (see [`load_data_instructions.md`](./docs/load_data_instructions.md)).  
3. Execute analytical queries (`queries.sql`).  
4. Export results to CSV (`results/`).  
5. Build the dashboard in Tableau or Power BI using the CSV outputs.

## ðŸ“‘ Raw Data Source

The dataset used in this project comes from [Kaggle - Insurance Claims Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/litvinenko630/insurance-claims).  
It contains **58K+ insurance policies** with details on policyholders, demographics, claim history, policy details, and vehicle risk factors.
